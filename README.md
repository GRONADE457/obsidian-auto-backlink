# Smart Mentions
Smart Mentions is an alternative to Obsidians default linked mentions view. Mentions are shown at the bottom center of the active note and ordered to give the most important notes first.

### Features
- Mentions are ordered by how many links they contain, making more important / central notes (like MOCs) appear first.
- Mentions are now always and easily accessible but don't hinder your view of the note.
- The note you came from is also displayed and is indicated by a ðŸ¡¨ in front of it.
- Excess mentions are put into a collapsible menu.
- Customisable using the Style Settings plugin (see below).
