# Mentions in the Status Bar
This plugin for Obsidian puts all the mentions of the current file into the status bar, making them easy to access at any time.

### Smart Mentions
Mentions are ordered by how many links they contain, making more important / central notes (like MOCs) appear first.

### Style Settings Support
This plugin supports the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin. The maximum width of the mentions block can be changed with this plugin.

### Credits
A portion of the [Auto MOC](https://github.com/dalcantara7/obsidian-auto-moc) plugin code is used. See main.ts for more.
